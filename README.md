Customer churn prediction is a critical aspect of business analytics, helping companies identify customers who are likely to stop using a product or service. By leveraging machine learning techniques, businesses can analyze historical customer behavior, transaction patterns, and engagement metrics to build predictive models. These models utilize features such as purchase frequency, support interactions, and account activity to classify customers into "churn" or "loyal" categories. Accurate churn prediction enables companies to take proactive measures, such as personalized offers or improved customer service, to retain valuable users. This repository contains datasets, code, and machine learning models for churn analysis, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification techniques using Python and popular ML libraries like Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow.
